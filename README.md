Overview

This repository contains the LaTeX source, documentation, and supporting code for my Master’s Thesis in Big Data Engineering.  
The project focuses on designing and implementing an end-to-end data pipeline for public transport analytics using **GTFS** and **XML operational data** from the Belgian railway operator **SNCB / NMBS**.

The work combines modern data engineering practices, data quality principles, and cloud-based processing using **PySpark**, **Azure Databricks**, **MongoDB**, and **FastAPI**.

###Project Summary

The objective of this thesis was to build a scalable and reliable data ingestion pipeline capable of:

- Collecting multimodal transport data from multiple sources (GTFS, XML)  
- Ensuring data quality and consistency  
- Transforming and storing structured data in a NoSQL database  
- Exposing cleaned data through a REST API for analytical access  
- Supporting operational and strategic insights for transport analysis# Thesis-BigData-JudithMartinez
